## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The JavaScript file calculates the time difference between the current date and **December 25**.  
2. It updates the countdown every second using `setInterval()`.  
3. A snow animation runs in the background for a cozy holiday feeling.  
4. When the countdown reaches zero — Christmas has arrived! 🎉
